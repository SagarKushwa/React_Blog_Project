            description: "Dunki worldwide box office collection day 2: Shah Rukh Khan's third film of the year, Dunki, released on December 21 and has grossed more than ₹102 crore globally in its first two days, as per film trade analyst Manobala Vijayabalan. Dunki also stars Taapsee Pannu, Vicky Kaushal and Boman Irani and is directed by Rajkumar Hirani. After the blockbuster success of his action films Pathaan and Jawan, Shah Rukh Khan is back with Dunki. On day 2, Friday, which was Salaar: Part 1 - Ceasefire's release day, Dunki collected ₹45.1 crore gross worldwide, Manobala Vijayabalan tweeted on Saturday. The film had grossed ₹57.43 crore on Thursday, taking its two-day worldwide gross to ₹102.53 crore. Dunki has been jointly bankrolled by Red Chillies Entertainment, Jio Studios and Rajkumar Hirani. The film has been written by Rajkumar Hirani, Abhijat Joshi and Kanika Dhillon. The comedy drama is based on illegal immigration, where people risk their lives to move abroad. An excerpt from Hindustan Times' Dunki movie review read, SRK (Shah Rukh Khan) is the star attraction in Dunki and the film presents him in an avatar that we have seen earlier as well, in fact, multiple times over. As the young clean shaven hero falling for the first girl he met in Punjab where he had come looking for someone, he is endearing and sweet. But, he gets better in the second half, when that stubble grows and the gang is on their way to London through paths and routes that are as difficult as it gets. Be it crossing the desserts in Iran or snowy mountains of their next destination, Khan doesn't fail to charm you. Of course after action packed Pathaan and Jawan earlier this year, Dunki is a total contrast and in that sense, it's refreshing to see SRK doing what he is best at."

            description: "China is to bring in new rules that will limit the amount of money and time that people can spend on video games. The restrictions are aimed at limiting in-game purchases and preventing obsessive gaming behaviour. The draft legislation is a blow to the world's largest online gaming market, which is still recovering from a previous crackdown. The news sent shares in tech giants tumbling and wiped tens of billions of dollars off their value. The planned curbs also reiterate a ban on forbidden online game content that endangers national unity and endangers national security or harms national reputation and interests. Beijing first moved against the gaming sector in 2021, ruling that online gamers under the age of 18 would only be allowed to play for an hour on Fridays, weekends and holidays. But the latest raft of restrictions goes further. Online games must not offer rewards that entice people to excessively play and spend, including those for daily logins and topping up accounts with additional funds, said the industry regulator, the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA). The removal of these incentives is likely to reduce daily active users and in-app revenue, and could eventually force publishers to fundamentally overhaul their game design and monetisation strategies, said Ivan Su, an analyst at Morningstar. China is the world's largest gaming market, and Tencent is the global leader in the sector in terms of revenue. The company dominates the Asian market and has invested in game studios across the world. Tencent Games vice president Vigo Zhang said Tencent would strictly implement any new regulatory requirements. The new draft rules have not veered from regulators ongoing focus on ensuring companies have reasonable business models and operating cadence, he said",

            description: "Creating the perfect batch of cookies is a delightful and rewarding experience, requiring meticulous attention to detail. Renowned Chef Amit Puri, a seasoned expert in the culinary world, shares his invaluable insights on avoiding common baking mistakes, ensuring your cookies turn out irresistibly delicious. Choosing the proper butter is fundamental in the world of cookie baking. Opt for unsalted, high-quality butter with at least 80% fat content. Margarine or salted butter can significantly alter the flavour and texture of your cookies, so choose wisely. In the realm of baking, precision is paramount. Invest in proper measuring tools to ensure accurate quantities of ingredients. Precision enhances consistency and maintains a harmonious balance of flavours. Avoid eyeballing measurements as they might disturb the proportions required in a recipe, leading to an undesirable cookie. Overcrowding the oven is a common pitfall. Its essential to give your cookies room to breathe. To achieve consistently perfect cookies, arrange them with ample space on the baking sheet, allowing for proper air circulation and even baking. Stale leavening agents can sabotage your cookie endeavours. Check the expiration dates of baking powder and baking soda to ensure they are active. Using stale ingredients can result often in flat and lifeless cookies lacking the desired rise and texture. A crucial tip - avoid overworking the dough. Handle your cookie dough with care, Chef Puri cautions. Overmixing can lead to tough cookies with a dense texture. To maintain a tender, melt-in-your-mouth quality, mix the ingredients until just combined. During the baking process, were all familiar with taking a peek into the oven too often. But little do we realise that each time we open the oven door, we allow heat to escape! Trusting the timer and checking for doneness only during the final minutes is key to achieving perfectly baked cookies. The journey to cookie perfection doesn't end when the timer buzzes. The importance of patience in the cooling process is often overlooked. Allow your cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack. This ensures proper setting, preventing breakage and ensuring a flawless finish. ",

The Chiefs Kingdom is happily embracing a new member. Superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes cant stop gushing about his teammate Travis Kelce's blossoming romance with pop queen Taylor Swift and how great the Cruel Summer singer is. The NFL star recently graced the exclusive interview session with CBS Morning. Mahomes, who himself appreciates the good bond between Swift and his spouse Brittany, has undoubtedly won over Swifties with his thoughtful actions and wise words regarding the musician. The Chiefs quarterback was heard complimenting Taylor Swift's professionalism throughout the interview and saying that he thought she was really calm and collected. “Shes top-tier at her profession, and to see how she drives and she becomes that — Dude, its really cool to hear about and to see, and now I have a first-hand look at that through Brittany and Travis eyes. He added that it was a bit awkward for him and the team during Kelce and Swift's early days, so everyone kept their personal lives private and allowed them to pursue their own interests. Then, he started bringing Taylor around, and he realized how cool of a person she was, and she is, and so for us, there were a couple of jokes here and there at the beginning, he added further. aylor Swift has become a familiar face at Kansas City Chiefs games. The NFL star previously highlighted Swift's influence in attracting new fans to the Chiefs, and now the quarterback considers her an integral part of the Chiefs' family. Shes just part of Chiefs Kingdom, And shes part of the team. Since the Lover singer went public with her relationship with the Chiefs' tight end, she's been hanging out a lot with Britney Mahomes. They hug, talk, and even go shopping together. Patrick highlighted this, saying, Its cool that shes become friends with Brittany. So for me, it's Travis, man, and he's lucky to be with a great girl and woman. It's been cool to interact with her. Taylor Swift is set to begin the next leg of her Eras tour in Tokyo next year. There's a possibility that Travis Kelce, accompanied by his best friend duo Patrick and Britney Mahomes, might travel overseas to show their support and cheer for the singer on the international tour.",

While that is natural for any fitness activity, HIIT stands apart as it is one of the most common activities which have gained significant traction in many trainers fitness schedules. That brings us to the following question: Are HIITs needed at all? Celebrity trainer Tridev Pandey who trains actors like Sanya Malhotra and Shweta Tripathi Sharma “absolutely” enjoys HIITs. In an Instagram post, he shared, I absolutely enjoy my high intensity workout sessions. Heres why: I feel the surge as HIIT increases my energy levels, leaving me invigorated and ready to conquer the day. Experience the afterburn as my body continues to torch calories post-workout, contributing to long-term fat loss. From sprints to burpees and even weights, I enjoy a workout menu that never gets boring, keeping both my body and mind engaged. Beyond physical gains, HIIT fosters mental resilience, pushing my boundaries and instilling a sense of accomplishment. Considering his viewpoint, we decided to reach out to our in-house experts to understand the pros and cons of HIIT and how to know whether it works for you. The adaptability and versatility of HIIT make it a suitable choice for individuals with diverse fitness goals and preferences, said fitness expert Garima Goyal.  High-intensity workouts are time-efficient. In our fast-paced lives, finding time for regular exercise can be challenging. HIIT allows individuals to achieve significant fitness gains in a relatively short amount of time compared to traditional steady-state cardio exercises. The concept of intervals, alternating between short bursts of intense effort and brief rest or lower-intensity periods, allows for maximum output in a condensed workout session, said Goyal. The intense effort during the workout creates an afterburn effect known as excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). This means that the body continues to burn calories at an elevated rate even after the workout has ended, contributing to greater overall energy expenditure, Goyal said. In addition to its impact on weight management, high-intensity workouts enhance cardiovascular health. The intense bursts of activity elevate heart rate and improve cardiovascular endurance. Over time, this can lead to a stronger and more efficient heart, reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes. The adaptability of HIIT makes it suitable for people of various fitness levels, allowing individuals to tailor the intensity to their specific needs and gradually progress.",

Additionally, the study, conducted by TRG Datacenters, found that most US-specific users too did not want to be on the Meta-owned platform. According to the data, the average searches per month with the phrase how to delete (my) Instagram account stood at 1,020,000 globally. This translates to 12,500 individuals per every 100,000 people worldwide. Similarly, in the United States, the phrase How to delete (my) Instagram account had 214,000 average monthly searches, and was searched by more than 60 individuals out of every 1000 people. As per the report, this is because some of the additions made to the platform over the years, have changed the original photo-sharing purpose of the app. Instagram has also increasingly become a place for influencers to make a career, meaning many peoples feeds include ads which could be seen as affecting the user experience, the report noted. The study, however, added that the social network still has more than 2 billion people using it worldwide, though it cautioned that if millions continue to seek deletion of their accounts, this could potentially alter Instagram's landscape within a year. Globally, Snapchat came second, with almost 128,500 users seeking deletion of their handles. Twitter, now called X, was third, followed by Telegram, and Facebook, another Meta-owned app, came fifth. TikTok, YouTube, WhatsApp (also Meta's), and WeChat, in that order, were next. In the US, meanwhile, Facebook was second, followed by X (Twitter), TikTok, Snapchat, Telegram, YouTube, WhatsApp, and WeChat. ",

            description: "As winter blankets the world in frosty landscapes, our dietary needs shift towards foods that can fortify our immune system and provide essential nutrients to combat the cold. One such nutritional powerhouse that can add a burst of vitality to your winter diet is sprouts. From supporting your immune system to promoting digestive health and enhancing your skils radiance, sprouts are a simple and delicious way to stay healthy and vibrant during the colder months. Here are six amazing health benefits of incorporating sprouts into your winter meals. Rich in Nutrients Sprouts are nutritional powerhouses, bursting with essential vitamins and minerals. As seeds germinate, their nutrient content multiplies. Sprouts are particularly rich in vitamins A, C, and K, along with minerals like iron, potassium, and calcium. These nutrients play a crucial role in supporting overall health, boosting immunity, and maintaining strong bones. Immune System Boost Winter is synonymous with cold and flu season, making it crucial to support our immune systems. Sprouts are a great source of antioxidants, which help combat oxidative stress and inflammation in the body. The high vitamin C content in sprouts further enhances immune function helping the body defend itself against common winter ailments. Digestive Health The germination process of sprouting seeds breaks down complex carbohydrates and makes them easier to digest. Additionally sprouts contain enzymes that aid in the digestion of proteins and fats. Including sprouts in your winter diet can contribute to a healthier digestive system, reducing the risk of bloating and indigestion. Weight Management For those looking to manage their weight during the winter months, sprouts are an excellent addition to your meals. These tiny greens are low in calories but high in fibre, promoting a feeling of fullness and preventing overeating. The fibre content also supports healthy metabolism and can contribute to weight loss or maintenance. Blood Sugar Regulation Maintaining stable blood sugar levels is crucial especially during the winter when indulgent holiday treats abound. Sprouts have been shown to have a positive impact on blood sugar regulation. The combination of fibre and nutrients in sprouts helps slow down the absorption of sugars, preventing spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels. Radiant Skin and Hair Winter weather can be harsh on the skin and hair leading to dryness and dullness. The vitamins and antioxidants in sprouts contribute to healthier skin by promoting collagen production and fighting free radicals. Additionally the abundance of nutrients supports shiny strong hair making sprouts a beauty-enhancing addition to your winter diet."

The Scream VII (Scream 7) project has been plagued by troubles, losing not only two of its main actors but also its director in the past few months. Christopher Landon, the filmmaker behind Happy Death Day and Freaky', announced his exit from the horror sequel on X Saturday, saying it was a nightmare experience. I guess now is as good a time as any to announce I 'formally exited Scream 7 weeks ago. This will disappoint some and delight others. It was a dream job that turned into a nightmare. And my heart did break for everyone involved. Everyone. But it's time to move on,” Landon wrote on X. I guess now is as good a time as any to announce I formally exited Scream 7 weeks ago. This will disappoint some and delight others. It was a dream job that turned into a nightmare. And my heart did break for everyone involved. Everyone. But it's time to move on. I have nothing. He added, “I have nothing more to add to the conversation other than I hope Wes' legacy thrives and lifts above the din of a divided world. What he and Kevin created is something amazing and I was honored to have even the briefest moment basking in their glow. Landon was referring to Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson, the original creators of the Scream franchise, which started in 1996 and became a huge hit. Landon was supposed to take over from Radio Silence, the directing duo that revived the series with Scream in 2022 and Scream VI in March 2023, which broke box office records for the horror genre. However, Landon faced a major setback when Spyglass, the studio behind the Scream movies, fired Melissa Barrera, one of the lead actors, over her social media posts that were deemed antisemitic. Barrera was let go in October, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, which she had been vocal about. Landon was unhappy with the decision and posted on X Nov. 21, This is my statement: 💔 Everything sucks. Stop yelling. He later deleted the post and said: This was not my decision to make. Another blow came when Jenna Ortega, another star of the Scream movies, decided not to return for the seventh installment. Ortega and her team made the choice before the SAG-AFTRA strike in the summer, but it was only revealed in November.",

            description: "Most of us use our phones all day considering we are living in a digitalised world. Having said that, a poor neck posture, especially where the head protrudes forward from the shoulders can place inexplicable stress on our neck. This forward head posture can cause neck pain, headaches, shoulder pain, reduced spinal flexibility, and even long-term spinal issues. It can also affect overall posture and contribute to muscular imbalances, said nutritionist and yoga trainer Juhi Kapoor in her Instagram post. This posture which is out of alignment with the spine is associated with activities like looking down at a smartphone or computer for extended periods. In this posture, the head moves in front of the shoulders, putting extra strain on the neck and upper back muscles. It can lead to discomfort, pain, and long-term issues. Maintaining a neutral head position aligned with the spine is essential for good posture and overall neck health, explained fitness expert Garima Goyal. To maintain good posture and reduce strain on the neck, aim for a neutral head position. Here are some key points for a proper sitting posture – Align your head and spine – Keep your head in a neutral position, directly above your spine. Sit back in your chair – Use the backrest for support and sit back in the chair to maintain the natural curve of your spine. Keep feet flat on the floor – Plant your feet flat on the ground to support your lower back. Use an ergonomic chair – Choose a chair that supports the natural curves of your spine and provides proper lumbar support. Elevate your screen – Position your computer monitor or device at eye level to avoid looking down or up for extended periods.

            description: "Actor Adarsh Gourav isn’t one to settle. After a string of successful performances in projects like The White Tiger and Guns and Gulaabs and awaiting the release of his next Kho Gaye Hum Kahan, Adarsh says he wants to diversify and be a filmmaker. The actor told Indianexpress.com that turning a director is part of his larger plan and hence doesn’t know till when will he continue being just a screen performer. In his latest Netflix film Kho Gaye Hum Kahan, the actor plays Neel, a 20-something fitness trainer who finds himself dating an Instagram influencer. While many actors have shared how they have started to draw a line when it comes to what and how much they share about their lives on social media, Adarsh says he looks at it slightly differently. I don’t even know for how long I am going to be an actor. I want to direct films, I already write. I want to start directing, I want to be a filmmaker. If it is not Instagram, it is going to be something else. What is important for me as a creator is that I constantly work on my skill set, what I am interested in and develop that. Instagram is a temporary source of distraction and a platform for me to put up my songs. Today it is Instagram, tomorrow it is going to be something else but what is going to remain is my idea of being a storyteller,” he added. Kho Gaye Hum Kahan, also starring Ananya Panday and Siddhant Chaturvedi, is set to release on Netflix on December 26. Adarsh said when the film came to him, he instantly connected with his character because he saw similarities between what he felt when he was growing up in Mumbai. About constantly feeling inadequate because of my surroundings. This was in 2007 when I was 13. So what my character was going through when he was 25, I had been through that at 13. I could relate to Neel projecting his insecurity on his father, constantly feeling angry and inadequate about a situation. The role also required him to undergo intense physical transformation, for which he trained for 15 months. Adarsh said he had never taken to calisthenics or gym before, which is what opened his eyes as he never considered building body as some sort of an achievement.",

            description: "Imagine an artificial intelligence that could predict when you will die just by looking at key details of your life. This ‘doom calculator’ is now a reality thanks to new AI research. But is this technology a pandora’s box we should avoid opening? Researchers in Denmark and the US have created an AI system called life2vec that can predict if someone will die within four years with over 75% accuracy. The AI crunched data on age, health, jobs, income and other factors for over 6 million Danes. According to the research paper, it was fed sentences about life events, like “In September 2012, Francisco received 20,000 Danish kroner as a guard at a castle in Elsinore. We use the technology behind ChatGPT (something called transformer models) to analyse human lives by representing each person as the sequence of events that happens in their life,” Sune Lehmann, lead author of the December 2023 study Using sequence of life-events to predict human lives,” told The New York Post. The researchers examined a mixed population of six million Danish people, who varied in sex and age, between 2008 and 2020. They then used the AI system to find out which subjects would live for at least four years after January 1, 2016. The scale of our dataset allows us to construct sequence-level representations of individual human life trajectories, which detail how each person moves through time,” reads the report. “We can observe how individual lives evolve in a space of diverse event types (information about a heart attack is mixed with salary increases or information about moving from an urban to a rural area). Over time, the AI became skilled at building full “life trajectories” for individuals with an accuracy rate of 78%. The researchers did not tell participants their predicted expiration dates though as they believe this would be very irresponsible. Certain traits like mental illness, being male, and having a skilled job were tied to earlier demise. Leadership roles and higher pay correlated with longer life. Beyond mortality, the AI can also forecast personalities and major life decisions. Lehmann also suggests that life2vec can help determine the factors that might help us live longer, although she admitted that they haven’t gone deep with this.",

Call it a guilty pleasure or a way to add a twist, but there is always something delicious about homemade meals. If you love to experiment, we chanced upon ace cricketer Virat Kohli‘s healthy recipe for fried rice. “Try making vegetable fried rice with vegetable stock. It is outstanding. It is better than any street style fried rice that you have eaten anywhere,” he shared in a conversation revolving around food, Bengaluru, and his brand One8Commune in a YouTube conversation with stand-up comedian Rahul Subramanian. He also shared in the same chat that dosas were a revelation “when I came to Bengaluru”. In Delhi, we had beetroot and carrot in dosas. Crispy dosas for me were unreal that is something I will never forget,” he said. Another dish he tried and which stood out for him was chicken crispy. I used to smash 30-40 pieces in one go when I was about 13 years old, he recalled. Compared to some roadside stalls and local joints, the homemade touch with carefully chosen ingredients and flavourful stock creates a distinct and satisfying experience, showcasing the art of mindful cooking and a delicious journey beyond convenience, said Shubham Parikh, food blogger, Mumbai Food Heaven. Kohli’s suggestion of making vegetable fried rice using vegetable stock is a great example of a healthy, flavourful dish, said registered dietitian Manvi Lohia, head of holistic health, and international business, Ekaanta, Haridwar. “Using vegetable stock instead of meat-based stocks or broths makes your dishes suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets. It allows you to enjoy the same depth of flavour without the use of animal products, said executive chef Vijesh Modi, Radisson Blu Plaza Resort and Convention Center, Karjat. The recipe’s inclusion of a variety of vegetables such as carrots, bell peppers, broccoli, and peas ensures a rich intake of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. These nutrients are crucial for maintaining a robust immune system and healthy skin. Moreover, using olive oil instead of animal fats or butter in the preparation significantly lowers the saturated fat content, Lohia said",

According to Barjatya, it is all about sticking to ’10 tips, tricks, truths’, he described in a thread on the microblogging site. I did this last year. You can, too, if you implement these 10 Tips, Tricks, and Truths in your daily routine. A thread that you MUST read before 2024,” he shared alongside two pictures showcasing before and after transformation pictures of himself. According to him: 1. Truth – There is no shortcut. The Internet is filled with people and content selling ‘shortcuts’ for virality, but trust me, there is no shortcut. The “hacks” you see on the internet will confuse you more. All you need is real work and dedication. 2. Tip – Don’t cut down calories aggressively. Otherwise, it will become difficult for you to sustain. Eating just enough is essential for your daily routine and workout performance. Cutting down calories will affect your sex life as well. 3. Tip – The day you don’t work out is when you ABSOLUTELY need to complete your protein intake correctly. Whey, chicken, tofu, soya, eggs, dal, sattu, fish, paneer, mutton, etc are some famous protein sources. 4. Truth – You will get lean when you get fit and healthier. Your face will become thin. The society and all the unfit people around you will call you ‘weak’; they will call you names and will try everything to derail you. Ignore them. They are jealous of you. 5. Trick – Eating salad, no-calorie beverages, and drinking water and coffee are great ways to curb your hunger when you are on a diet. They help a lot. 6. Tip – How you train is much more important than the weight you lift at the gym. Imagine your muscles are rubber bands, the more you load and stretch them with good tension, the better they will react. 7. Tip – Do leg presses and extensions if you can’t squat. If you can’t deadlift – do hamstring curls; if you can’t bench press – do machine press. Machines are great. You can use them daily. Many great athletes of the world use machines to work out. 8. Truth – Peanuts or peanut butter aren’t a source of protein, they have a high amount of calories coming from FATs Oats can be replaced by Daliya. Millets are good but can cause bloating in many people. A cholesterol profile is very important for your overall health. 9. Tip – Walking and slow cardio are the easiest ways to burn calories. You can cycle while taking a meeting or walk around the house. Or get a walking pad if walking outside feels risky due to street dogs and traffic.",

            description: "Anil Kapoor recalls the time when he set out to be an actor in Hindi cinema and was waiting for good roles to come his way. Actor Anil Kapoor has completed 40 years in the Hindi film industry but his initial years weren’t as smooth despite being the son of well-known producer Surinder Kapoor. The actor said that his father had declared that he would have to make it on his own in the industry and would not receive any help from him. In an interview with Midday, Anil remembered his father, who passed away in 2011. Anil said, “He was very honest, decent, and kind of an introvert. He was a good man and so he was not one of the pushy, filmy or aggressive ones. He was a gentleman. The actor added, “He very clearly told me that ‘I cannot do anything for you’ and I never expected him to do anything for me. So from the day, I felt instinctive, I said, ‘It’s time for me to get out, go to the battlefield, and fight it out’. However, things were not as smooth as one would expect them to be for a star kid. The lack of good offers did have a negative impact on Anil, who was roaring to take on Bollywood. It was exhausting, it was tiring, frustrating. I looked worse, I felt worse. I used to sit with my friends and have Rum. I was a bitter person,” he said, while adding, “I channelled it in my work. Awaragi, Mashaal. You see that anger, it was that anger and bitterness. Awaragi was much later but Mashaal, yes. Anil made his acting debut with the Telugu film Vamsa Vruksham, right after playing a small role in the Hindi film Humaare Tumhaare. However, recognition came to him with the 1983 film Woh Saat Din. Ever since, the actor has given several blockbusters like Mr India, Beta, Lamhe, and Nayak amongst others. Most recently, the actor delivered a hit with Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal. He essayed the role of Ranbir Kapoor’s father in the movie. He will be next seen in Fighter, opposite Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone. The film will hit the theatres on January 25, 2024.",

            description: "Beeper Mini, which offers iPhone messaging on Android phones, has grown fast and its duel with the tech giant has gotten the attention of antitrust regulators. For years, Ben Black’s phone annoyed his family. It was the only Android device in a family message group with eight iPhones. Because of him, videos and photos would arrive in low resolution and there would be green bubbles of text amid bubbles of blue. But a new app called Beeper Mini gave him the ability to change that. Black, 25, used the app to create an account for Apple’s messaging service, iMessage, with his Google Pixel phone number. For the first time, every message the family exchanged had a blue bubble and members were able to use perks like emoji and animations. Since it was introduced Dec. 5, Beeper Mini has quickly become a headache and potential antitrust problem for Apple. It has poked a hole in Apple’s messaging system, while critics say it has demonstrated how Apple bullies potential competitors. Apple was caught by surprise when Beeper Mini gave Android devices access to its modern, iPhone-only service. Less than a week after Beeper Mini’s launch, Apple blocked the app by changing its iMessage system. It said the app created a security and privacy risk. Apple’s reaction set off a game of whack-a-mole, with Beeper Mini finding alternative ways to operate and Apple finding new ways to block the app in response. The duel has raised questions in Washington about whether Apple has used its market dominance over iMessage to block competition and force consumers to spend more on iPhones than lower-priced alternatives. The Justice Department has taken an interest in the case. Beeper Mini met with the department’s antitrust lawyers Dec. 12, two people familiar with the meeting said. Eric Migicovsky, a co-founder of the app’s parent company, Beeper, declined to comment on the meeting, but the department is in the middle of a 4-year-old investigation into Apple’s anti-competitive behavior. The Federal Trade Commission said in a blog post Thursday that it would scrutinize “dominant” players that “use privacy and security as a justification to disallow interoperability” between services. The post did not name any companies. The battle also caught the attention of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. The committee’s leadership — Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Mike Lee, R-Utah — wrote a letter to the Justice Department expressing concern that Apple was snuffing out competition. Apple declined to comment on the letter.",

            description: "During winter, our immune system may face increased challenges due to factors like cold weather, reduced sunlight exposure, and the prevalence of cold and flu viruses. Superfoods, which are nutrient-dense and rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, can play a crucial role in supporting and strengthening the immune system. These foods provide essential nutrients that contribute to the production and functioning of immune cells, helping the body fend off infections and illnesses more effectively, according to Dr G. Sushma Kumari, clinical dietician, CARE Hospitals, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad. 7 Winter Superfoods to Boost Immunity - itrus Fruits (e.g., Oranges, Grapefruits, and Clementines) – How they help: Citrus fruits are packed with vitamin C, an antioxidant that supports the production of white blood cells and antibodies, essential components of the immune system. Broccoli – How it helps: Broccoli is rich in vitamins A, C, and E, as well as fibre. It contains sulforaphane, a compound that has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Garlic – How it helps: Garlic contains allicin, a compound known for its antimicrobial properties. It may help enhance the immune system’s ability to fight infections. Ginger – How it helps: Ginger has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It may help reduce inflammation, and its warming effect can be soothing during the cold winter months. Spinach – How it helps: Spinach is a nutrient powerhouse, providing vitamins A and C, as well as various antioxidants. It also contains iron, which is important for maintaining a healthy immune system. Yoghurt (Probiotics) – How it helps: Yoghurt with live cultures is a source of probiotics, which support gut health. A healthy gut microbiome is linked to a strong immune system. Nuts and Seeds (e.g., Almonds and Sunflower Seeds) – How they help: Nuts and seeds are rich in vitamin E, an antioxidant that plays a role in immune function. They also provide healthy fats that support overall well-being. Here are some additional tips for incorporating superfoods into your diet during winter. – Include a variety of these superfoods in your meals to ensure a diverse range of nutrients. – Consider incorporating them into smoothies, salads, or snacks. – Choose whole, minimally processed foods for maximum nutritional benefits. Remember, while superfoods can contribute to overall health and immunity, a balanced diet, regular exercise, and sufficient sleep are essential components of a healthy lifestyle, especially during the winter months.",

            description: "Marvel had more riding on Jonathan Majors than perhaps any other actor. Now it’s parting ways with him, and throwing years of plans for its cinematic universe in disarray. Marvel Studios and the Walt Disney Co. dropped Majors from all future projects following the actor’s conviction for assault and harassment on Monday, according to a person close to the studio who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The swift move by Disney marked a stunning about-face for an actor who had been one of Hollywood’s fastest-rising stars. A Manhattan jury on Monday found the 34-year-old Majors guilty of one misdemeanor assault charge and one harassment violation for a March altercation with his then-girlfriend Grace Jabbari. Majors, who was acquitted of a different assault charge and of aggravated harassment, will be sentenced on Feb 6. He declined to comment as he left the courthouse. Majors’ attorney, Priya Chaudhry, said in a statement that “it is clear that the jury did not believe Grace Jabbari’s story of what happened in the SUV because they found that Mr Majors did not intentionally cause any injuries to her. Mr Majors still has faith in the process and looks forward to fully clearing his name,” said Chaudhry. As the superhero studio prepared phase five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it cast the highly acclaimed Majors as the antagonist Kang the Conqueror. The character was to span several films and series as the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s next-phase answer to Thanos, the villain of Avengers: Endgame. Majors had already appeared in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and the first two seasons of Loki. He was to star in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, dated for release in May 2026. The future of The Kang Dynasty is now unclear. Disney declined to comment on whether it will recast the role of Kang or pivot in a new direction. The studio has been preparing for the possibility of Majors’ exit from the franchise. But Marvel was limited in its ability to fashion rewrites due to the screenwriters strike that ran from May to late September. The studio recently hired screenwriter Michael Waldron to rework The Kang Dynasty. For Marvel, Majors’ departure adds to a series of recent setbacks. Though its box-office success — nearly $30 billion worldwide from 33 films — is unsurpassed in movie history, the superhero factory has recently seen some atypical struggles. The Marvels, released in November, has been the MCU’s worst performer in theaters, with $204 million in worldwide ticket sales.",

Another wrote, Wow that’s a great transformation. Creating a structured routine can help to set the tone for a productive day, explained Varun Rattan, co-founder of The Body Science Academy, Noida. “Adopting habits such as exercise, meditation, and goal-setting, can give you a sense of consistency and purpose that extends throughout your daily activities,” said Rattan in an earlier interaction with indianexpress.com. According to fitness expert Garima Goyal, discipline can automatically come when one focuses on adequate rest and recovery, especially when the body is sore. When your body is sore after exercise, it’s essential to take care of it to aid in recovery. Here are some tips – 1. Rest – Give your body time to heal and rebuild the muscles. Avoid overtraining and allow for adequate rest between intense workouts. 2. Stretch – Gentle stretching can help alleviate muscle soreness and improve flexibility. Focus on the most sore areas. 3. Hydration – Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, which helps flush out toxins and reduces muscle cramps. 4. Nutrition – Consume a balanced diet with adequate protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats to support muscle recovery. 5. Ice or heat – Applying ice or heat can help relieve soreness. Ice is good for acute inflammation, while heat can be soothing for muscle tightness. 6. Gentle activity – Light, low-impact activities like walking or swimming can help improve blood flow and reduce stiffness.",

            description: "Sridhar Vembu is known for his passion for rural India, and the confidence that billion dollar companies can be run from small towns. Every place in India cannot expect huge investments and we cannot replicate a Silicon Valley everywhere. Even in the US, places like Boston and South Carolina tried to replicate Silicon Valley, but they were not successful. That is the way that financial capital and tech talent works. They have their priorities. For the last five years, a team of 150 engineers have been working day in and out in a tiny Indian village in Tenkasi, about 650 kms south of Chennai, building a world-class context-aware helpdesk software called Zoho Desk. This may sound like it's straight out of the plot of a movie, but Sridhar Vembu, CEO of Zoho Corp has ensured it became a reality with his able guidance and vision. As a result, Zoho, a multi-billion dollar customer management (CRM) company with offices in Chennai and Silicon Valley, has achieved something no company can boast of- harnessing and training the talent in rural India to build a software product for a global market. “Zoho has challenged conventional wisdom so many times in its history. We built the first software products from India when IT services were the rage and established them in the global market. We are now showcasing something that has never been done before: the first software product created in rural India, world-class in its refinement, competing with the best,” said a proud Sridhar Vembu, CEO, Zoho Corp. Zoho Desk, which is the sixth product that the company has launched in 2016, uses customer data from past interactions and from other Zoho products, like Zoho CRM and Zoho Projects, to organise tickets and intelligently present information to agents so that they can better understand a customer's problem and resolve it efficiently. It thus helps companies deliver the right solution at the right time. Its clean user interface packs innovations like Work Modes that help agents send context-aware responses, the Headquarters dashboard that provides the visibility managers need to make better decisions, and the Team Feed to help the entire company participate in customer service. As is the case with every Zoho product, Zoho Desk is also available for free up to 10 users. Paid plans begin at Rs 720 per user per month for the Professional Edition and increase to Rs 1,500 per user per month for the Enterprise version.",

            description: "As we journey through the world of nutrition, exploring the benefits that various vegetables bring to our well-being, the humble turnip emerges as a nutritional powerhouse deserving of our attention. Often overshadowed by more popular counterparts, this root vegetable boasts a rich history and a robust nutritional profile that may surprise many. We delve into the nutritional intricacies of turnips, uncovering the valuable components that make them not only a versatile culinary addition but also a noteworthy contributor to a health-conscious diet, guided along by Ekta Singhwal, Dietician, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals. Immunity: Turnip provides vitamin C, supporting immune function and protecting cells from oxidative stress. – Diabetes Control: The soluble fibre in turnip helps regulate blood sugar levels, potentially benefiting individuals with diabetes. Turnips (Brassicarapa) are a root vegetable and member of the cruciferous family, along with other vegetables like bok choy, Brussels sprouts, and kale. They’re one of the world’s most important vegetable crops, as they’re used to feed both humans and cattle. The most common types of turnip are purple, red, or greenish on the outside and have a white-fleshed bulb — also called the storage root or organ — which grows above the ground and has a smooth skin without scars or side roots. Both their roots and leaves, also known as turnip greens, are safe to eat, and like most cruciferous vegetables, they’re praised for their health-promoting effects. This article reviews turnips, including their nutritional content and health benefits. Both the roots and leaves are great sources of vitamin C, which protects your body from free radical damage when levels of these molecules become too high in the body. This nutrient also improves iron absorption and helps regulate blood cholesterol, among many other health benefits. Furthermore, turnip greens are rich in the fat-soluble vitamins K and A, the type that your body absorbs better when consumed with fats. Vitamin K plays an essential role as a clotting agent, meaning that it helps prevent excessive bleeding. Plus, vitamin A is vital for eye, skin, and lung health. Additionally, the leaves contain high amounts of folate, which aids the production of red blood cells and helps prevent developmental irregularities in fetuses. The study also determined that the extract helped correct other metabolic disorders associated with diabetes, such as high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Similar results were found after testing the antidiabetic effects of turnip greens. One 28-day study in rats with diabetes observed that those fed a daily dose of 90–180 mg of turnip leaf extract per pound (200–400 mg per kg) experienced significantly reduced blood sugar, as well as lower total and LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. Moreover, given the recent rise in cases of bacterial resistance, researchers have conducted test-tube and animal studies to evaluate the potential effect of combining isothiocyanates with standard antibiotics. The results suggest that together, they may exert a more significant effect in controlling bacterial growth",

            description: "The popular Netflix show for babies and preschoolers, CoComelon, has sparked controversy with its new spinoff series, CoComelon Lane. Parents are divided over recent episodes that introduce LGBTQ characters and depict a scene where a boy explores different costumes, including a tutu and tiara, in a heartwarming moment with his two dads. In the episode segment titled Just be me, the young boy engages in dress-up with his same-sex parents, seeking their input on various costumes. The heartening message revolves around self-expression, as the parents encourage him to embrace who he is. This scene has become a focal point of the controversy, with some praising its inclusivity and others expressing strong reservations. The clip shared on End Wokeness on X, garnered over 7 million views in less than 24 hours, igniting a wave of discontent among parents. Critics argue that the show has taken a woke turn, going beyond promoting acceptance of same-sex families and allegedly encouraging cross-dressing. Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, expressed feeling disgusted and went as far as suggesting the show is attempting to groom children. Hild's concerns extend beyond general acceptance, suggesting that the episode carries a political agenda. He claims that introducing such themes in well-established shows is an insidious tactic by media companies. Hild cites instances like drag queen story hours and explicit books in schools, emphasizing the need for vigilance regarding children's content. Parents on various platforms, including X and Common Sense Media, voiced their discontent. Some expressed frustration over the perceived intrusion of a woke agenda into children's programming, lamenting the loss of wholesome content. The sentiment echoes a broader concern about the trend of media companies infusing social messages into children's shows. While many parents expressed dismay, some welcomed the show's diversity and dismissed critics as homophobic. The divide among parents highlights the challenge media companies face in navigating societal changes while catering to diverse audiences. The clash of perspectives underscores the complexities of introducing inclusive themes in children's content. Netflix's history with LGBTQ content: CoComelon Lane is not Netflix's first venture into introducing LGBTQ content in children's shows. Previous instances, such as a Netflix Jr. cartoon teaching preschoolers about nonbinary identities, have also faced backlash. The streaming giant did not respond to requests for comments on the recent controversy.",

            description: "Kidneys are bean-shaped organs that form an essential part of the urinary system as they help the body pass waste in the form of urine while also filtering blood before it is sent back to the heart. Besides this, they also perform a wide range of vital functions like maintaining fluid balance in the body, regulating and filtering minerals from the blood, separating waste materials from food, medications and toxic substances and making hormones that aid in the production of red blood cells, promote good bone density and regulate blood pressure. Living donors: Since the human body can function healthily with just one well-functioning Kidney, a family member may choose to donate one of them to a close relative. If the family member’s blood and tissues match the Kidney receiver’s blood and tissues, they can schedule a planned donation. A Kidney from a family member is ideal as it reduces the risk of rejection and allows immediate surgery. Deceased donors: Also called cadaver donors; these are people who have perished, usually as the result of an accident rather than a disease. Cadaver organ donation means organ donation after brain death certified by a special team of the hospital. In this case, either the donor before his death or their family has chosen to donate their organs and tissues. As far as cadaver organ donation is concerned, a pledge card or consent by the closest relative is mandatory. In some cases, a donor’s Kidney can be rejected by the recipient. Dr Atul Ingale informed, “Once a potential donor is identified, the transplant patient must undergo a test to ensure the antibodies will not attack the donor’s Kidney. This test is performed by mixing a small amount of the patient’s blood with the specific donor. The transplant cannot be performed if the patient’s blood forms antibodies in response to the donor’s blood. However, if the blood does not show any antibody reaction, the surgeon can perform the transplant. If the transplant is from a living donor, the surgeon can schedule the surgery in advance. However, if the donor is deceased and is a close match in terms of tissue type, then the patient will need to be available for surgery the moment the donor is identified. Dr Atul Ingale explained, “During a Kidney transplant, a Nephrologist will take the donated Kidney and place it in the patient’s body. In the case of a Kidney transplant, you can seek a donation from a close family member, as people can live a healthy life with only one functioning Kidney. After the transplant, the patient who underwent the transplant is required to take immune-suppressing medications so that their immune system does not attack the new organ. According to the Indian Society of Organ Transplants (ISOT), 1.75 lakh patients are waiting for a Kidney transplant. The average wait time for a Kidney transplant is 3-5 years at most centers, but it can be longer in some parts of the country. For example, in Karnataka, the waiting time for a Kidney transplant is at least four years. Dr Atul Ingale answered, “In patients whose Kidneys do not function correctly, Dialysis treatment will be needed so toxins do not build up in the body. This is a treatment where toxins are mechanically filtered from the bloodstream. Some patients whose Kidneys have failed may qualify for a Kidney transplant. In this procedure, either one or both the Kidneys are replaced with donor Kidneys from a live or deceased person. However, Kidney transplants are not the right choice for everyone. People who have active infections and those who are severely overweight may not be accepted as candidates for a transplant.",

I always wanted to work with her. I told her and she also knows that. I told her, ‘Sorry, nothing is bigger than the film.

            description: "A life sentence in a hospital prison awaits Arion Kurtaj, the 18-year-old hacker who leaked Grand Theft Auto 6 footage online. The BBC reports that a British judge decided on Thursday that Kurtaj poses a serious threat to the public as he has not given up his desire to engage in cybercrime. Kurtaj was part of Lapsus$, a hacking group that targeted GTA 6 developer Rockstar Games and other firms, such as Uber and Nvidia. A jury in London concluded in August that Kurtaj was responsible for the cyberattacks, but he was not tried for his criminal intent as he has autism and was unfit to stand trial. The jury only had to determine if he did the acts he was accused of. The judge heard on Thursday that Kurtaj “had been violent while in custody with dozens of reports of injury or property damage,” according to the BBC. A mental health evaluation also revealed that Kurtaj “continued to express the intent to return to cybercrime as soon as possible.” He will remain in the hospital prison for life unless doctors deem him safe to be released. Kurtaj was out on bail for hacking Nvidia and BT / EE, a British telecom company, when he leaked 90 GTA 6 gameplay footage in September. He was under police protection at a hotel, but he still managed to hack Rockstar Games by using the Amazon Fire Stick in the room and a “newly purchased smart phone, keyboard and mouse,” the BBC says in another report. He was arrested for the last time after this incident. Another 17-year-old member of Lapsus$ received an 18-month community sentence, known as a Youth Rehabilitation Order, and a prohibition from using virtual private networks. The official trailer for GTA 6 was released earlier this month, and it got hundreds of millions of views despite the leak of the videos by Kurtaj and the early release of the trailer on X (formerly Twitter). The outlet reports that the judge dismissed Kurtaj’s defence that the trailer’s popularity should be considered in the sentencing, saying that Lapsus$ harmed real people and businesses. Rockstar Games claimed it spent $5 million to recover from the attack. ",

He has released five stand-up specials on Comedy Central and Netflix, including his most recent Netflix special, Live From The Los Angeles Forum.

We are thrilled to have Jo host the 81st Annual Golden Globe Awards and bring his infectious energy and relatable humor to kick off Hollywood’s award season,” said Helen Hoehne, Golden Globes president, in a statement Thursday. “We know Jo is bringing his A-game. I’ve stepped onto a lot of stages around the world in my career, but this one is going to be extra special. I’m so excited to be hosting the Golden Globes this year,” said Koy in a statement. “This is that moment where I get to make my Filipino family proud. Greta Gerwig's Barbie leads the Globes nominations with nine nods, including for best picture musical or comedy as well as acting nominations for Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling and three of its original songs. It is closely followed by its release date and meme companion Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, which scored eight nominations, including for best picture drama and for actors Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt. The Globes' voting body has now grown to 300 members, following backlash after a 2021 report in the Los Angeles Times found there were zero Black members in the group that was then composed of only 87 foreign journalists. The 81st Golden Globes will be the first major broadcast of awards season, with a new home on CBS. The Globes had long been one of the highest-profile awards season broadcasts, second only to the Oscars. Before the pandemic, it was still pulling in around 19 million viewers. The show was touted as a boozy, A-list party whose hosts often took a more irreverent tone than their Academy counterparts. ",

            description: "Are you aware that our body is home to trillions of bacteria? Yes, you read that right. We do harbour both good and bad bacteria in our body where due to the immunity function in our body, the good bacteria far outweigh the bad. Our immune system protects us against harmful viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms that can cause a wide range of illnesses and diseases. In other words, if the immune system does not function properly, the harmful bacteria in our body will wreak havoc and cause diseases that can endanger not just your own lives but also those around you. In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Shobha Subramanian Itolikar, Consultant-Internal Medicine at Fortis Hospital in Mulund, shared, “As per a recent study conducted in Florida, we all carry harmful bacteria on our mobile phones and smartwatches and spread them around unknowingly. This can seem anticlimactic as smartwatches are also playing a vital role in improving the fitness goals of individuals across the globe. Since they can track vital health signs like heartbeat, stress levels and activity levels like daily steps, these gadgets are quite popular, especially with fitness enthusiasts.She explained, “Most of us wear wearable devices for extended hours from sunrise to sunset. As a result, these wearables are exposed to sweat, grime and whatnot, including toilet pathogens. Since we don’t clean the watches regularly, they quickly become a hotbed of pathogenic bacteria like Salmonella (the notorious Typhoid bacterium), Staphylococcus (the bacteria responsible for skin boils), Pseudomonas, and Escherichia Coli, to name a few. The study has further elucidated that the number of bacteria found on these devices also depended on the type of wristbands used. While rubber and plastic bands had the most bacteria on them, metal bands (especially gold and silver), on the other hand, were virtually free from bacteria. Dr Shobha Subramanian Itolikar elaborated, “These transmissible bacteria are hazardous as they can cause various invasive diseases, especially in individuals with low immunity, like children, older adults, diabetics, cancer patients, etc. While the wearer of the smartwatch can have a robust immune system, they might not contract the disease themselves. Still, there is a high risk of these individuals becoming ignorant carriers of diseases and transmitting these viruses/ bacteria to those with immunocompromised immunity systems. It is imperative to raise awareness about the need to clean and disinfect wearable devices, especially those we use regularly. These small steps will go a long way in preventing the spread of diseases and pathogens that can otherwise become extremely viral and cause a lot of infections in the broader population.",

In a new interview with Mashable India, Katrina looked back at her journey. She revealed that she only wanted to be a model when she moved to Mumbai and acting happened to her by accident. When I started off as a model in Bombay, my intention was to be a model. My role models were Madhu Sapre and Lakshmi Menon. Those were the supermodels of that time. And even Malaika actually. She was still modelling at that time. They were the women I looked up to. And that's what I wanted to be as a model, Katrina said. While Katrina and Malaika have never worked together, they once had a peculiar connection. Katrina was dating her Tiger 3 co-star Salman Khan when his younger brother, actor and producer Arbaaz Khan, was married to Malaika. While Katrina later dated actor Ranbir Kapoor before marrying actor Vicky Kaushal in 2021, Malaika divorced Arbaaz in 2017 before she started dating actor Arjun Kapoor. Malaika started off in 1997 as a VJ on MTV. She then entered the modelling world and appeared in Bally Sagoo's memorable 1997 music video of Gur Naalo Ishq Mitha. She made her Bollywood debut with the iconic dance song Chaiyya Chaiyya alongside Shah Rukh Khan in Mani Ratnam's 1998 romantic film Dil Se. Malaika went on to do dance songs in movies for the next 25 years, right up till Anirudh Iyer's An Action Hero last year, where she shook a leg with Ayushmann Khurrana on Aap Jaisa Koi. She was also seen in the Disney+ Hotstar reality series Moving in with Malaika last year. She'll be next seen in a special appearance in Arjun Varain Singh's buddy movie Kho Gaye Hum Kahan, releasing on Netflix India this Tuesday on December 26. Katrina will be next seen in Sriram Raghavan's Merry Christmas.",

According to a study released by the American Psychological Association that synthesised more than 50 years of research on sleep deprivation and mood, it may hinder our emotional functioning, diminish good emotions, and increase our risk of anxiety symptoms. In our largely sleep-deprived society, quantifying the effects of sleep loss on emotion is critical for promoting psychological health, said study lead author Cara Palmer, PhD, of Montana State University. This study represents the most comprehensive synthesis of experimental sleep and emotion research to date, and provides strong evidence that periods of extended wakefulness, shortened sleep duration, and nighttime awakenings adversely influence human emotional functioning. The study was published in the journal Psychological Bulletin. Palmer and her colleagues, including co-lead author Joanne Bower, PhD, of East Anglia University, analyzed data from 154 studies spanning five decades, with 5,715 total participants. In all those studies, researchers disrupted participants' sleep for one or more nights. In some experiments, participants were kept awake for an extended period. In others, they were allowed a shorter-than-typical amount of sleep, and in others, they were periodically awakened throughout the night. Each study also measured at least one emotion-related variable after the sleep manipulation, such as participants' self-reported mood, their response to emotional stimuli, and measures of depression and anxiety symptoms. Overall, the researchers found that all three types of sleep loss resulted in fewer positive emotions such as joy, happiness and contentment among participants, as well as increased anxiety symptoms such as a rapid heart rate and increased worrying. This occurred even after short periods of sleep loss, like staying up an hour or two later than usual or after losing just a few hours of sleep, Palmer said. We also found that sleep loss increased anxiety symptoms and blunted arousal in response to emotional stimuli.",

            summery: "Young lives have often been lost by the time lupus disease is diagnosed. Read on to know its causes, symptoms, treatment and prevention tips",
            description: "The word Lupus is a Latin word meaning “wolf” and this word was coined because the rash in a patient with Lupus resembles the bite of the wolf! Lupus is a Chronic Auto-Immune Disease where the body’s autoimmune system instead of serving its normal protective function, forms antibodies which start attacking healthy tissues and causes inflammation. In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Kaushik Bhojani, Head of Rheumatology Services at Fortis Hospitals in Mumbai, explained, “Normally these antibodies are meant to fight outside infections such as bacteria and viruses. However, in Lupus, the body loses its ability to differentiate between these foreign invaders (antigens) and our normal healthy tissues. Hence the body’s own immune system begins to fight against its own self. The antibodies then combine with the self-antigens and forms immune complexes within tissues which cause inflammation within the organs. This can sometimes cause major health issues and can even be life threatening! He added, “Quite often, in our country, this disease is diagnosed late because the patient reaches the Rheumatologist late. By this time, the inflammation has spread to involve multiple organs and then the disease becomes life threatening. Young lives have often been lost by the time this disease is diagnosed. According to Dr Kaushik Bhojani, the causes of Lupus are many and sometimes quite obscure where Lupus occurs in a genetically susceptible person who is exposed to a trigger. Pregnancy can trigger a flare of lupus hence, patients having Lupus must plan their pregnancy only when the disease is well controlled and consult their Rheumatologist who will do a detailed workup before the couple plans their pregnancy. A key symptom, as per Dr Kaushik Bhojani, is a skin rash involving the face, particularly the cheeks bones - known as ‘Malar Rash’. This is usually in the shape of butterfly wings and hence is also called a butterfly rash. When there is a combination of more than one symptom present, it is easier to suspect this illness. Dr Kaushik Bhojani highlighted, Usually, it is common for a patient to consult his or her family physician in case of fever, generalised body ache etc and if the onset of illness is with joint pains, usually a patient first consults a nearby Orthopedic surgeon.

            description: "The physician-researchers at Massachusetts Eye and Ear hospital in the US have concluded that the paralysis was likely a downstream effect of the viral infection, and that it may be another addition to the well-established nervous system-related or neuropathic complications observed in children and adults. The patient, an otherwise healthy 15-year-old female, was presented to the emergency department 13 days after diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection with acute onset shortness of breath, the researchers described in their study published in the journal Pediatrics. She had a history of asthma and anxiety. An endoscopic examination revealed bilateral vocal cord paralysis, which refers to an immobility of both vocal cords found in the voice box or the 'larynx', the researchers said. Given how common this virus is among children, this newly recognised potential complication should be considered in any child presenting with a breathing, talking or swallowing complaint after a recent Covid-19 diagnosis, said first author Danielle Reny Larrow, a resident in the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at Massachusetts Eye and Ear. This is especially important as such complaints could be easily attributed to more common diagnoses such as asthma, said Larrow. While at the hospital, the patient underwent a detailed battery of diagnostic tests, including blood work, imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and consultations with otolaryngology (medicine specialty dealing with diseases of ear, nose and throat), neurology, psychiatry, speech language pathology and neurosurgery, the researchers said. When speech therapy failed to relieve the patient's symptoms, the physicians performed a tracheostomy - a surgically created opening in the windpipe - to relieve the patient's breathing difficulties. They reported that she remained tracheostomy-dependent for more than 13 months after initial treatment, suggesting that this type of nerve complication may not be temporary. They said were able to remove it fifteen months after insertion following a case report submission. Describing it as highly unusual, the team said that this was the first report of an adolescent experiencing post-viral neuropathy, which is known to cause vocal cord paralysis, even as several adults have reported this complication as a result of Covid-19 infection. The fact that kids can actually have long term neurotrophic effects from Covid-19 is something that it's important for the broader pediatric community to be aware of in order to be able to treat our kids well, said senior author Christopher Hartnick, director of the Division of Pediatric Otolaryngology and Pediatric Airway, Voice, and Swallowing Center at Massachusetts Eye and Ear.",

            description: "In a world where superhero movies are increasingly becoming all too common, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is like a fish out of water—predictable, wet, and desperately gasping for relevance. Directed by James Wan, the reported $205 million-spectacle aims to be the final curtain call for the DCEU before it undergoes a much-needed facelift by James Gunn and Peter Safran. As the DCEU braces for a reboot, this underwater escapade serves as a reminder that even Atlantis can't escape the undertow of creative fatigue. Jason Momoa reprises his role as the oceanic Adonis, Arthur Curry, who finds himself in a battle against an ancient power threatening to wreak havoc on Atlantis. The stakes are high, and the budget is even higher, yet the sequel to the 2018 film, unlike its predecessor, struggles to stay afloat in the sea of superhero mediocrity. Momoa's charisma may be as mighty as a tidal wave, but not even his considerable biceps can lift this sinking ship. Returning cast members Amber Heard (Mera), Nicole Kidman (Atlanna), and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Black Manta) try their best to salvage the wreckage, but their efforts are akin to rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. Dolph Lundgren reprises his role as King Nereus, and Randall Park (Dr Shin) swaps his comedic hat for a more serious one, but even their talents can't prevent the film from feeling like a soggy sequel desperately clinging to past glory. The plot, like a half-hearted breaststroke, moves forward without much finesse. Arthur faces off against his arch-nemesis, Black Manta, who is armed with the formidable Black Trident and harboring a grudge more ancient than the power he seeks. To spice things up, Arthur forms an alliance with his half-brother Orm, earnestly played by Patrick Wilson, in a twist that's as surprising as Aquaman's ability to communicate with fish. The film attempts to explore themes of brotherhood, betrayal, and redemption, but the execution is clumsy. The movie's underwater extravaganzas and mythical creatures are reminiscent of a visually stunning acid trip. James Wan, known for his mastery of fantasy and horror, crafts a spectacle, but its grandiosity often feels like a cheap attempt to distract from its lackluster plot. It's as if Wan took a page from the Michael Bay playbook, swapping substance for explosions and subtlety for CGI tidal waves. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom goes through its plot points with the subtlety of a torpedo, leaving a wake of predictability in its path. The film leans heavily on familiar tropes, as if it raided the clearance section of the superhero storytelling handbook. Scenes crucial to character development and plot progression follow a well-trodden path, robbing us of the excitement that comes with the unexpected.",

            description: "Zac Efron didn't realize how much he needed a hug. He'd transformed himself into a mass of muscle and repressed emotion to play professional wrestler Kevin Von Erich in the new film The Iron Claw. It was a taxing role and unlike anything he’d done before, both physically and psychologically. He often found himself with real bruises from recreating fights in the ring. Downtime between shots, too, was usually spent lifting. But he hadn’t quite realized how much it was affecting him until he and Lily James sat down to film the first date between his character and the woman who would marry him. Pam tells Kevin that he has oldest brother syndrome. Kevin tells her that he’s not actually the oldest: That brother died in an accident when he was 6 and Kevin was 5. He says he’s fine, but Pam gets out of her seat, walks around the table and drapes her arms around Kevin, who seems to melt in the warmth of a love that’s not conditional. It felt very needed, that hug,” Efron told The Associated Press in a joint interview with James. “It was the first time I’d embraced anyone in months without it being a fake punch, or someone trying to submit me or get me to tap out. Efron is half-laughing but also not. If you know anything about the Von Erichs, sometimes referred to as the Kennedys of wrestling, you know that the tragic death of the oldest brother is not the last that they would endure. In fact, the completely true account of what would transpire was too much for even the film to bear: By the time Kevin was 35 he’d have lost his four remaining brothers, three to suicide. For The Iron Claw, in theaters on Friday, writer-director Sean Durkin made the decision to take the youngest, Chris, out entirely. The Iron Claw is still primarily about the relationship between the brothers David (Harris Dickinson), Kerry (Jeremy Allen White) and Mike (Stanley Simons) and their father Fritz (Holt McCallany), a wrestler who dreamt of greatness for himself and his family at any cost. Kevin told Durkin that he just wanted audiences to know how much the brothers loved one another. As a lifetime wrestling fan who grew up following the Von Erichs, who presided over the Texas wrestling scene in the 1970s and 80s, Durkin was fascinated by ideas of American masculinity, trauma and grief, as well as Kevin’s relationship with Pam that somehow survived through it all. Though Kevin had spoken a lot about his life after the deaths, there wasn’t much Pam “out there,” Durkin found. But instead of a hinderance, it provided an opportunity to be creative and make it personal. He’d already decided that he wanted to write and figure out the story before getting in touch with his real-life subjects. James joined the project a bit later than everyone else. Efron recalled a “collective jump for joy upon finding out that she'd said yes. Though they didn't know one another beforehand, they quickly established a natural rhythm that would prove to be magic on camera and off.",

Majors first played a version of the villain Kang in the season finale of the 2021 Disney+ series Loki. The incident that led to the trial involved a domestic dispute in March, between Majors and his former girlfriend Grace Jabbari. Majors had previously pleaded not guilty to misdemeanour charges of assault and aggravated harassment. Majors, since his arrest, has been dropped by his talent manager, Entertainment 360, and his publicity firm, the Lede Company. He is neither involved with the Protagonist Pictures film The Man in My Basement.’ Further, the US Army pulled an ad campaign that featured the actor, and so did the Texas Rangers baseball team. Other projects involving Majors that remain in a state of uncertainty include Spike Lee’s Da Understudy’ for Amazon and the Dennis Rodman film 48 Hours in Vegas for Lionsgate. Majors faced four misdemeanour charges for misdemeanour assault, aggravated assault and harassment. Ultimately, he was convicted of third-degree assault and second-degree harassment, according to The Guardian. However, the actor was acquitted on another assault charge and one count of aggravated harassment. His sentencing is scheduled for February 6, 2024. The actor faces up to one year in prison or probation. While Majors was present in the New York City courtroom during the proceedings, he did not testify. The New York Times reported that on December 5, Jabbari testified that she was assaulted by Majors in the backseat of a car during the dispute. Prosecutors claimed the incident took place after Jabbari noticed a romantic text message someone had sent him on his phone. Prosecutors claimed during closing arguments that Majors “didn’t hesitate to use physical violence” against Jabbari. He allegedly twisted her right arm behind her back and then “struck a blow” to her head. Majors’ attorney alleged that the accusations are “fake” and that Jabbari was the aggressor. ",

Investors potentially involved in the fundraising round have been included in preliminary discussions, according to the people, who asked not to be identified to discuss private matters. Details like the terms, valuation and timing of the funding round haven’t yet been finalized and could still change, the people said. If the funding round happens as planned, it would make the artificial intelligence darling the second-most-valuable startup in the US, behind only Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to data from CBInsights.

OpenAI’s rocketing valuation matches the AI frenzy it kicked off one year ago after releasing ChatGPT, a chatbot capable of composing eerily human sentences and even poetry in response to simple prompts. The company became Silicon Valley’s hottest startup, and a new appreciation for the promise of AI changed the tech industry landscape within a few months.

Altman Sought Billions For Chip Venture Before OpenAI Ouster.

            description: "Hyperloop One, the high-speed freight transportation firm, will shut down its operations on December 31, Bloomberg reported. The decision comes after the company once backed by Virgin Atlantic boss Richard Branson failed to win a contract to build a working hyperloop. In November 2020, the Virgin Hyperloop, renamed after Branson invested in it, had completed the world's first passenger ride on the high-speed system, reaching speeds of up to 107 miles per hour (172 kph) at the company's DevLoop test site in Las Vegas, US, Guardian had reported. Hyperloop had envisioned a future in which floating pods packed with passengers and cargo would run through vaccum tubes at a speed of 966 kph or faster. The Los Angeles-based firm will sell off its remaining assets, while the employment for its remaining employees will end on Dec. 31 this year, the report added. A hyperloop system uses magnetic levitation to allow near-silent travel. With this, a trip between New York and Washington would take just 30 minutes - twice as fast as a commercial jet flight and four times faster than a high-speed train. Elon Musk had reignited interest in the technology in 2013 by setting out how a modern hyperloop system would work. His own tunneling enterprise, The Boring Company, is seeking to send passengers packed into pods through an intercity system of giant, underground vacuum tubes known as the hyperloop. Hyperloop One was founded in 2014 and raised more than $400 million, largely from United Arab Emirates shipping company DP World and British billionaire Richard Branson. The company witnessed a turbulent journey since inception, including a fight between its co-founders. It was renamed as Virgin Hyperloop One after Branson invested in 2017. Branson slammed Saudi Arabia following the killing of Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, the Middle East kingdom pulled a planned project with the startup. Branson stepped down as chairman, TechCrunch reported. DP World wound up with majority control of the startup, and pivoted its focus to cargo in early 2022, cutting half the staff at the time and dropping the Virgin moniker. The UAE shipping giant will wind up with Hyperloop One’s intellectual property. The emergence of hyperloop in the West led to speculations whether such a high-speed system could be implemented in India. However, NITI Aayog member VK Saraswat ruled out hyperloop tech, saying that it is at a 'very low level' of maturity and may not be economically viable at the current juncture. Hyperloop technology as far as we are concerned, we found that the offer which came from foreign countries are not very viable options. They are at a very low level of maturity of technology, Saraswat had told PTI in an interview.",

Turning end-of-life computers into the magnets that power sustainable technologies like electric vehicles and wind turbines will help meet the rising global demand for electricity, said Noveon Magnetics Chief Commercial Officer Peter Afiuny.
